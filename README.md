aihelp is a terminal-based AI assistant powered by Groq’s LLaMA 3. It lets you ask natural-language questions and get instant answers directly from your terminal.

It’s lightweight, fast, and simple to use. Just type:
aihelp ask "Do LLaMAs dream of electric computers?"

API Key Setup

This project requires a Groq API key: https://console.groq.com

After creating an account, set your key like this:

export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key-here"

Have fun! I hope the LLaMA won't spit in your face.
